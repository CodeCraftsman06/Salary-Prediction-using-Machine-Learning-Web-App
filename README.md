# flask-salary-predictor
This is project predicts the salary of the employee based on the experience.

# Model
model.py trains and saves the model to the disk.
model.pkb the pickle model 

# App
app.py contains all the requiered for flask and to manage APIs.



Procedure--
Open command Prompt and go to given directory and then run python app.py


# My ML Project

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict employee salaries based on their years of experience. The model is deployed using a Flask web application.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the Flask application code.
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training the model.
- `model/`: Contains the saved machine learning model.
- `static/`: Contains static files like CSS.
- `train_model.py`: Script to train and save the model.
- `app.py`: Main script to run the Flask application.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
